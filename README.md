Exadel Authoring Kit for AEM (part of Exadel Toolbox), or simply the **ToolKit**, is a set of tools for creating robust Granite/Touch UI dialogs and other authoring interfaces for Adobe Experience Manager&trade; with Java and Maven.

The ToolKit provides the fastest way to supplement an AEM component based on a Sling model or POJO with an autogenerated _Touch UI_ dialog and/or in-place editing interface. It also supports automatic generation of page properties dialogs, design dialogs and similar interface types.

The ToolKit has many options to make authoring interfaces rich, flexible, and responsive with minimal effort. No deep knowledge of Granite&trade;, Coral&trade;, or AEM clientlibs is needed. A scope of fine interactivity features is ready out of the box with minimal to no manual setup.

The ToolKit is compliant with the newest facilities of AEM 6.4/6.5, Granite UI, and Coral v.3+, and has support for Coral v.2.

The ToolKit is developed in the course of Exadel&trade; Marketing Technology Practice (the MarTech) as a part of **Exadel Toolbox** initiative.

It is an open and growing project. The authors sincerely welcome creative input from the AEM community worldwide to bring the best programming techniques and design.
