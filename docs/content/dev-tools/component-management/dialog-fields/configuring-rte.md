## Configuring RichTextEditor

[RichTextEditor (RTE)](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/administering/operations/rich-text-editor.html?lang=en) is a somehow special yet vastly demanded dialog component that makes it possible to edit strings and texts with WYSIWYG experience. The functionality of the component is based upon a set of plugins, either built-in or custom. Most plugins expose sets of "features" reflected by UI elements (buttons, or dropdown lists, or button panels, or floating panels - so called "popovers").

Traditionally, to add a feature to the RichTextEditor, a user needs to include a string representing a button in the *toolbar* attributes of one or more XML nodes, include another node representing a plugin to a corresponding plugin tree and/or populate the *features* attribute of that node and then possibly set the plugin's custom features, each in its own specific format. If the feature is to sit in a floating panel, the *\<popovers>* node and its sub-nodes must also be taken care of.

The ToolKit streamlines that workflow a lot.

### RTE features and popovers

To initialize a RichTextEditor component with certain plugins/features, youâ€™ll need to apply a `@RichTextEditor` annotation to a class field and then set the annotation's features property. This property accepts an array of strings in a plugin#feature format. To specify a popover, you must add to the array a square-bracketed string like *[plugin#feature1, plugin#feature2,...plugin#featureN]* or *[plugin:feature1:feature2:...featureN]* depending on the plugin's specification.

The built-in plugin#feature pairs are stored as constants of `RteFeatures` class for convenience. Feature sets of various built-in plugins are grouped by a plugin (so that to show them in separate popovers) and are stored within the RteFeatures.Popovers class. Definitions of specific panels are in the RteFeatures.Panels class (for now only one specific panel, "table", is supported).

The nearly maximal set of built-in features for a RichTextEditor can be exposed in the following manner:

```java
@RichTextEditor(
    features = {
        RteFeatures.Popovers.CONTROL_ALL,
        RteFeatures.UNDO_UNDO,
        RteFeatures.UNDO_REDO,
        RteFeatures.SEPARATOR,
        RteFeatures.Popovers.EDIT_ALL,
        RteFeatures.Popovers.FINDREPLACE_ALL,
        RteFeatures.SEPARATOR,
        RteFeatures.Popovers.FORMAT_ALL,
        RteFeatures.Popovers.SUBSUPERSCRIPT_ALL,
        RteFeatures.Popovers.STYLES,
        RteFeatures.Popovers.PARAFORMAT,
        RteFeatures.Popovers.JUSTIFY_ALL,
        RteFeatures.Popovers.LISTS_ALL,
        RteFeatures.Popovers.LINKS_MODIFY_DELETE,
        RteFeatures.SEPARATOR,
        RteFeatures.Panels.TABLE,
        RteFeatures.SPELLCHECK_CHECKTEXT,
        RteFeatures.Popovers.MISCTOOLS_ALL,
        RteFeatures.FULLSCREEN_TOGGLE,
    }
)
private String text;
```

In addition to built-in features, you can append features provided by a custom RTE plugin using the same string format. Technically, the plugin searches for plugin#feature strings and converts each into a toolbar button. Then it searches for *[plugin#feature1,plugin#feature2]* patterns and converts each into a popover. The first *plugin#feature* entry becomes the button to bring on the popover. This one and all the rest of the entries are shown as the popover content.

This is how you alter any of the predefined popovers or compose a different popover (from either built-in, or custom features, or both). See the following snippet that indicates appending a custom feature, then two custom popovers to a feature set:

```java
@RichTextEditor ( /* ... */
    features = {
        "some#feature",
        RteFeatures.BEGIN_POPOVER +
            "myPlugin#feature1" + RteFeatures.FEATURE_SEPARATOR +
            "myPlugin#feature2" +
        RteFeatures.END_POPOVER,
        RteFeatures.BEGIN_POPOVER +
            RteFeatures.FORMAT_BOLD + RteFeatures.FEATURE_SEPARATOR +
            "myAnotherPlugin#feature3" + RteFeatures.FEATURE_SEPARATOR +
            RteFeatures.LINKS_ANCHOR +
        RteFeatures.END_POPOVER
    }
)
```

### RTE view modes

RichTextEditor configuration allows specifying features for three different editor modes. These are:

- *inline* (for an ordinary dialog window),
- *dialogFullScreen* (for a "maximized" dialog window), and
- *fullscreen* (for a dialog window which shows after "ToggleFullscreen" button pressed and for a "maximized" in-place editor).

You can specify sets of features for *inline* and *dialogFullScreen*/*fullscreen* modes separately by populating "features" and *fullscreenFeatures* properties, respectively. These two properties accept values in the same format, or you can use one set of features for either by populating only "features".

Generally it is recommended that a narrower set of features be used for the *inline*( e.g. "windowed" mode) and popover elements avoided in this mode due to unwanted visual effects and that a wider set of features with popovers unrestricted be used for any of the "fullscreen" modes.

If neither *features* nor *fullscreenFeatures* are populated, a default set of buttons will be generated for each of the three editor modes.

### Toolbar icons

A user can override existing or add new icon definitions for toolbar buttons via the *icons* property. Several icon definitions may be missing from the Coral installation. To provide a complete user experience with the mentioned full feature set, you may use the following snippet:

```java
@RichTextEditor ( /* ... */
    icons = {
        @IconMapping(command = "#edit", icon = "copy"),
        @IconMapping(command = "#findreplace", icon = "search"),
        @IconMapping(command = "#links", icon = "link"),
        @IconMapping(command = "#table", icon = "table"),
        @IconMapping(command = "#subsuperscript", icon = "textSuperscript"),
        @IconMapping(command = "#control", icon = "check"),
        @IconMapping(command = "#misctools", icon = "fileCode"),
    }
)
```

### Settings for pasting text

One substantial concern for a RichTextEditor component is the rules for processing the input from the clipboard. A user may specify *defaultPasteMode* and *htmlPasteRules* for dealing with non-plaintext clipboard content as in the snippet below:

```java
@RichTextEditor ( /* ... */
    defaultPasteMode = PasteMode.WORDHTML,
    htmlPasteRules = @HtmlPasteRules(
        allowBold = false,
        allowItalic = true,
        allowImages = false,
        allowLists = AllowElement.ALLOW,
        allowTables = AllowElement.REPLACE_WITH_PARAGRAPHS,
        allowedBlockTags = {"p", "sub"},
        fallbackBlockTag = "p"
    )
)
```

Setting the [htmlLinkRules](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/administering/operations/configure-rich-text-editor-plug-ins.html?lang=en#linkstyles) property allows you to also control the way internal and external links in pasted text are processed. See the following snippet:

```java
@RichTextEditor ( /* ... */
    htmlLinkRules = @HtmlLinkRules(
        cssInternal = "my-internal-link-style",
        cssExternal = "my-external-link-style",
        targetInternal = LinkTarget.MANUAL,
        targetExternal = LinkTarget.BLANK,
        protocols = {Protocol.HTTP, Protocol.HTTPS},
        defaultProtocol = Protocol.HTTPS
    )
)
```

### Inserting special characters

Among the commonly user RTE assets is the *misctools#specialchars* feature that represents an "Insert symbol"-like dialog. The set of Unicode characters to offer may be defined in specialCharacters property. This is an array that stores either a single HTML entity definition or a Unicode range (decimal values) as in the following snippet:

```java
@RichTextEditor ( /* ... */
    specialCharacters = {
        @Characters(name = "Copyright", entity = "&copy"),
        @Characters(name = "Euro sign", entity = "&#x20AC"),
        @Characters(name = "Registered", entity = "&#x00AE"),
        @Characters(name = "Trademark", entity = "&#x2122"),
        @Characters(rangeStart = 512, rangeEnd = 514),
        @Characters(rangeStart = 998, rangeEnd = 1020)
    }
)
```

### Paragraph tagging and text styles

Set of formatting tags for a "paraformat" button can be defined in [formats](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/administering/operations/configure-rich-text-editor-plug-ins.html?lang=en#operations) property as in the snippet:

```java
@RichTextEditor ( /* ... */
    formats = {
        @ParagraphFormat(tag = "h1", description = "My custom header"),
        @ParagraphFormat(tag = "h2", description = "My custom subheader")
    }
)
```

RichTextEditor allows altering the visual representation of the text by [CSS rules](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/administering/operations/configure-rich-text-editor-plug-ins.html?lang=en#textstyles). Property *externalStyleSheets* is for specifying an array of strings representing paths to JCR-stored CSS files that will be applied to the RTE content. After *externalStyleSheets* are set, you can populate the *styles* property with the CSS classes that will be offered to a use in styles dropdown, as in the below snippet:

```java
@RichTextEditor ( /* ... */
    externalStyleSheets = {
        "/etc/clientlibs/myLib/style1.css",
        "/etc/clientlibs/myLib/style2.css"
    },
    styles = {
        @Style(cssName = "my-style", text = "My custom style 1"),
        @Style(cssName = "my-another-style", text = "My custom style 2")
    }
)
```
Unlike *formats* above, these are not HTML tag definitions but rather *\<span style='...'>...\</span>* blocks that will be added to selected text.

### Miscellaneous tweaks

Additionally, a user can specify the number of edit operations stored for undo/redo logic (via [maxUndoSteps](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/administering/operations/configure-rich-text-editor-plug-ins.html?lang=en#undohistory) property), the width of tabulation (in spaces, via [tabSize](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/administering/operations/configure-rich-text-editor-plug-ins.html?lang=en#tabsize) property), and the indentation margin of lists (in spaces, via [indentMargin](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/administering/operations/configure-rich-text-editor-plug-ins.html?lang=en#indentmargin) property).
