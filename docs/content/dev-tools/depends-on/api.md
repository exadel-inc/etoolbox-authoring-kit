## Actions

### Built-in State Actions
There is a list of built-in form field state actions.
They use boolean query results.
Note: as an agreement due to compatibility state actions named shortly by the managed state name.
Here is a list of the available actions:
* `visible` (or `visibility`) - hide the element if the Query result is 'falsy'. <u>This is the default action that is applied when no action is specified.</u>
* `hidden` - hide the element if the Query result is 'truthy'
* `tab-visibility` - hide the tab or the element's parent tab if the Query result is 'falsy'
* `readonly` - set the readonly marker of the field from the Query result.
* `required` - set the required marker of the field from the Query result.
* `disabled` - set the field's disabled state from the Query result. Supports multiple actions effect for the same field.
* `enabled` - unset the field's disabled state from the Query result. Supports multiple actions effect for the same field.

### Built-in Form Field Actions
* `set` - set the Query result as the field's value (undefined Query result skipped)
* `set-if-blank` - set the Query result as the field's value only if the current value is blank (undefined Query result skipped)
* `set-placeholder` - set the Query result as the field's placeholder (undefined Query result skipped)

* `validate` - set the validation state of the field from the Query result.

### Async actions

Built-in plug-in async actions:
* `fetch` - an action to set the result of fetching an arbitrary resource.
  It uses Query result as a target path to a node or property.
  The path should end with the property name or '/' to retrieve the whole node.
  The path can be relative (e.g. 'node/property' or '../../property') or absolute ('whole/path/to/the/node/property').
  _Additional parameters:_
    * `map` (optional) - function `(result: any, name: string, path: string) => any` to process result. Can be used as mapping/keys-filtering or can provide more complicated actions.
    * `err` (optional, map to empty string and log error to console by default) - function `(error: Error, name: string, path: string) => any` to process error. Can be used to map or ignore error results.
      Note: If the mapping result is `undefined` then the action will not change the current value.
    * `postfix` (optional, `.json` by default) - a string to append to the path if it is not already presented

### Widget-specific actions

* `update-options` - changes the option set of a Granite Select component based on the path from the Query result. The path can lead to any endpoint that is supported by the [Option Provider mechanism](../option-provider.md).

## Action Registry

Custom action can be specified using `Granite.DependsOnPlugin.ActionRegistry`.

An action should have a name and function to execute.
Action names support lower-case letters, numbers and '-'. All upper-case letters will be transformed to lower case.
For example built-in `set` action is defined as follows:
```javascript
Granite.DependsOnPlugin.ActionRegistry.register('set', function setValue(value) {
    if (value !== undefined) {
        Granite.DependsOnPlugin.ElementAccessors.setValue(this.$el, value);
    }
});
```

## Reference Types

Allowed reference types:
* `boolean` - cast to boolean (according to JS cast rules)
* `boolstring` - cast as a string value to boolean (true if string cast equals "true")
* `number` - cast to number value
* `string` - cast to string
* `json` - parse JSON string

If the type is not specified manually, it will be chosen automatically based on the type of element widget
(see _preferableType_ in the ElementsAccessor definition).

In any other case (e.g. if the type is `any`), no cast will be performed.

Note: If you use a Hidden field to save a temporary boolean result, use `boolstring` reference type in order to retrieve it.

## ElementsAccessor Registry

Registry `Granite.DependsOnPlugin.ElementAccessors` - can be used to define the custom accessors of an element.
The accessor provides information on how to get/set values, set a require/visibility/disabled state, or returns `preferableType` for the specific type of component.

For example, a default accessor descriptor is defined as follows:
```javascript
Granite.DependsOnPlugin.ElementAccessors.registerAccessor({
    selector: '*', // Selector to filter element
    preferableType: 'string',
    get: function($el) {
        return $el.val() || '';
    },
    set: function($el, value) {
        $el.val(value);
    },
    placeholder: function ($el, value) {
        $el.attr('placeholder', value);
    },
    required: function($el, val) {
        $el.attr('required', val ? 'true' : null);
        $el.attr('aria-required', val ? 'true' : null);
        Granite.DependsOnPlugin.ElementAccessors.updateValidity($el);
    },
    visibility: function ($el, state) {
        $el.attr('hidden', state ? null : 'true');
        $el.closest('.coral-Form-fieldwrapper').attr('hidden', state ? null : 'true');
        if (!state) {
            Granite.DependsOnPlugin.ElementAccessors.clearValidity($el);
        }
    },
    disabled: function ($el, state) {
        $el.attr('disabled', state ? 'true' : null);
        $el.closest('.coral-Form-fieldwrapper').attr('disabled', state ? 'true' : null);
        if (!state) {
            Granite.DependsOnPlugin.ElementAccessors.clearValidity($el);
        }
    }
});
```

### Custom Accessor
You can create a custom accessor to override the default behavior of the DependsOn plugin.
Or you can use adaptive accessors to provide a custom accessor for a specific component property.

Here is a list of public methods to control or use DependsOn ElementsAccessors:

* `Granite.DependsOnPlugin.ElementAccessors.registerAccessor(accessor)` - register a new accessor
  Note if you register a new accessor with selector `*`, it will override the default accessor behaviour.
  Such accessors are not bubble and are used only if there is no custom accessor definition for the specific component.
* `Granite.DependsOnPlugin.ElementAccessors.getAccessor($el, type)` - get the accessor for the element
  Accessor property returns as it is, the function accessor will be bound to the accessor object.
* `Granite.DependsOnPlugin.ElementAccessors.getManagedAccessor($el, type, inverced)` - get the accessor for the element
  Returns wrapped boolean state accessor wrapped with ManagedState utility. That means accessor will support actor based state management disallowing state change if not all of the actors "free" target state.
  The `inverced` parameter is used to define which truthy or falsy state should be used as `free` state from actor perspective.

## Query Syntax

A Query is a plain JavaScript condition or expression.
Any global and native JavaScript object can be used inside a Query.
You can also use dynamic references to access other fields' values.
In order to define a reference, the referenced field's name should be specified in a `dependsOnRef` attribute.
Then the reference will be accessible in the Query using the `@` or `@@` symbol and reference name.

### Using Semicolons in DependsOn Queries

DependsOn queries are always treated as a single JavaScript expression and never as multiple statements in one line.
Semicolon symbols (`;`) within a DependsOn Query must be escaped.

If you add a Query via a Java annotation, semicolons will be escaped automatically:
```java
class MyComponent {
    @DependsOn(query = "@field === ';'")
    private String field1;
}
```
But, if you write directly to XML or HTML, you should escape them by hand:
```xml
<granite:data dependson="@field === '\\;'"/>
```

If you need to actually execute several JavaScript statements within a DependsOn,
you can do this by wrapping them in a function call:
```java
class MyComponent {
    @DependsOn(query = "function(){ var a = @field1 + @field2; return a * a < 4; }()")
    private String field;
}
```

Be aware that it is still better to move complex structures to a standalone client library
```javascript
  // project-clientlib.js
  window.MyUtils = window.MyUtils || {};
  window.MyUtils.fieldAccepted = function (field1, field2) {
      var a = field1 + field2;
      return a * a < 4;
  };
```
```java
class MyComponent {
    @DependsOn(query = "MyUtils.fieldAccepted(@field1, @field2)")
    private String field;
}
```

### Query Reference Syntax

There are two versions of references available in the Queries:
- 'Single' reference: `@reference`. 'Single' reference starts from the `@` symbol in the Query, it allows you to access a defined field value.
  'Single' reference should reference an existing field and will not be reattached on dynamic DOM change.
- 'Multiple' reference: `@@reference`. Starts from double `@` symbols. Allows you to access a group of field values marked by the same reference name.
  'Multiple' reference always returns an array in the Query.

Note: 'multiple' reference triggers Query update on any group update: changing some of groupâ€™s fields value or adding/removing a referenced field.

'this' is a reserved word for reference names. Using `@this` you can retrieve the value of the current element. In this case there is no need to specify a reference name unless you want to use it outside the current element.

The area to find a referenced field can be narrowed down by providing the Scope.
The Scope is a CSS Selector of the closest container element.
The Scope is defined in parentheses after the reference name.

Examples:
* `@enableCta (coral-panel)` - will reference the value of the field marked by `dependsOnRef=enableCta` in bounds of the closest parent Panel element.
* `@enableCta (.my-fieldset)` - will reference the value of the field marked by `dependsOnRef=enableCta` in bounds of the closest parent container element with "my-fieldset" class.
* `@@enableCta (coral-multifield)` - will reference all values of the fields marked by `dependsOnRef=enableCta` in bounds of the closest multifield.

"Back-forward" CSS selectors are available in the Scope syntax, i.e. we can define the CSS selector to determine the parent element and then provide a selector to search the target element for scope in bounds of the found parent.
Back and forward selectors are separated by '|>'.

For example:
* `@enableCta (section |> .fieldset-1)` - will reference the value of the field marked by `dependsOnRef=enableCta` in bounds of element with `fieldset-1` class placed in the closest parent section element.

## Multiple Actions
Multiple actions with Queries can be defined.
Queries/Actions should be separated by ';' and placed in the same order.
The number of Actions should match the number of Queries.

Static actionâ€™s params can be passed through data attributes with the following syntax:
- for a single and first action `data-dependson-{action}-{paramName}` can be easily accessed and used from action,
  e.g. `data-dependson-validate-msg` will be used by `validate` action as invalid state message
- for multiple actions of the same type additional actions params should end with `-{index}` (1 for the second action, 2 for the third).
  e.g. `data-dependson-validate-msg-1` will be used by second `validate` action as invalid state message

### Multiple State Actions
The default state actions use managed state implementation, which means that u can define multiple queries with the same actions for the same field.

For example, multiple `disable` actions will be treated as disjunctive state:
```html
<granite:data
    data-dependson="query1; query2"
    data-dependson-action="disable; disable"/>
```
is equivalent to:
```html
<granite:data
    data-dependson="query1 || query2"
    data-dependson-action="disable"/>
```

Multiple positive state actions will be treated as conjunctive state.
For example, multiple `visible` actions will be treated as conjunctive state:
```html
<granite:data
    data-dependson="query1; query2"
    data-dependson-action="visible; visible"/>
```
is equivalent to:
```html
<granite:data
    data-dependson="query1 && query2"
    data-dependson-action="visible"/>
```
