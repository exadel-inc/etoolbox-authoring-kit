## Plugin settings

### componentsPathBase

Specifies the path to a folder in the current package where the AEM components are situated. Whenever you specify the `path` property of `@AemComponent` as a relative path (without leading */*), its value is appended to the _componentsPathBase_. This setting is mandatory.

### componentsReferenceBase

Specifies the root package to scan for AEM components' back end Java classes. This setting is optional. It can be used to limit the scope of classes scanned by the plugin. By default, the plugin would scan all the classes available in the classpath, spanning across bundles. This can be undesirable if, for example, there are several Java classes referring to the same AEM component.

### terminateOn

Specifies the list of exceptions, comma-separated, that would cause this plugin to terminate
the build process.

Each item may present:
- a particular exception, by its fully qualified name like `java.io.IOException`. When a singular exception is specified, all subclasses of the provided class also count;
- or a package where multiple exceptions reside, like `com.exadel.aem.plugin.exceptions.*`.

Apart from this, you may specify the values `all` (alias `*`) and `none`.
If an exception or a group of exceptions must be explicitly neglected, `!` should be prepended to the item.

Exception patterns are considered in order. Earlier patterns are applied before later patterns. For example, if `java.*, !java.lang.RuntimeException` is provided, and a `NullPointerException` is thrown, the second ("negated") pattern will have no effect, since any exception originating from the `java` package has already been accounted for by the first pattern. That is why, if you need to define a scope of exceptions that would cause termination but need to explicitly exclude some items from that scope, you should put "negated" patterns in the first spot.

It is also considered a good practice to end the enumeration with a default "fallback" pattern, typically `*`, if there are exclusions on the list. So, `<terminateOn>!java.lang.NullPointerException, !com.exadel.aem.plugin.exceptions.*,java.lang.RuntimeException</terminateOn>`, or `<terminateOn>!java.lang.RuntimeException, !iava.io.IOException, *</terminateOn>` would be some good samples.

If *terminateOn* is not configured, the default setting is effective. By default, the plugin will terminate on an `IOException` or one of its derivatives.
